     <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
    <main>
      <p>
        <span>I’m Ankit Khatiwada-</span> a creative and detail-oriented <span
          >frontend developer</span
        >
        from Nepal. I specialize in building <br /><br>
        clean, responsive websites using<span> HTML and CSS,</span> and I’m
        currently expanding my skills in  <span
          >JavaScript and <br /><br>
          React.js.</span
        >
        My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity about
        how <span>websites </span>  work, which <br /><br>
        quickly turned into a <span> passion</span> for creating beautiful and
        user-friendly digital experiences. I enjoy turning <br /><br>
        ideas into <span>functional</span> and <span
          >visually appealing websites,</span
        >
        with a strong focus on simplicity, structure, and <br /><br>
        mobile responsiveness. I believe a great website should not only look
        good but also be fast, accessible, and <br /><br>
        easy to navigate. Outside of  <span>coding,</span> I spend my time
        learning new tools, exploring design trends, <br /><br>
        and helping others understand the basics of <span
          >frontend development.</span
        >
        I'm always open to new <span
          >opportunities, <br /><br>
          collaborations,</span
        >
        and<span> creative challenges</span> that help me grow and improve as
        a <span>developer.</span>
